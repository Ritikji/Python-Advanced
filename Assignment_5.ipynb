        "Ans - Multiple inheritance refers to the ability of a class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes. In other words, a class can derive characteristics from more than one base class. This feature allows a derived class to inherit and combine behaviors from multiple sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "In languages that support multiple inheritance, a class can have more than one direct superclass. This means that the class can inherit members (attributes and methods) from multiple parent classes, forming a hierarchical relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "When a class inherits from multiple parent classes, it gains access to all the attributes and methods defined in each parent class. This enables the derived class to reuse and combine functionalities from different sources, providing flexibility and code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, multiple inheritance can also introduce complexity and potential conflicts. For example, if two parent classes define a method with the same name, the derived class may face ambiguity in method resolution. Programming languages that support multiple inheritance typically have mechanisms to handle such conflicts, such as method resolution order (MRO) algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to use multiple inheritance judiciously, considering the design and maintainability of the code. Proper planning and understanding of the relationships among classes are necessary to ensure that multiple inheritance is used appropriately and effectively."

        "Ans- The concept of delegation refers to a design pattern or technique where an object passes on a specific task or responsibility to another object to perform it. In delegation, instead of implementing the task directly, an object delegates or assigns the responsibility to another object that is better suited or specialized to handle that task.\n",
        "\n",
        "Delegation is often used to promote code reuse, modular design, and separation of concerns. It allows objects to collaborate and work together by distributing responsibilities among them.\n",

        "3. Collaboration: Delegation enables collaboration between objects. Objects can work together by delegating tasks to each other, utilizing each other's specialized capabilities and functionalities.\n",

        "4. Code Reuse: Delegation promotes code reuse by allowing objects to reuse existing code from other objects. Rather than duplicating code, an object can delegate tasks to an existing object that has already implemented the desired functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Flexibility: Delegation provides flexibility in the sense that it allows objects to dynamically change their behavior by delegating tasks to different objects at runtime. This flexibility can enhance the modifiability and extensibility of the codebase."

        "Ans- The concept of composition in software development refers to the construction of complex objects or structures by combining simpler objects or components. It involves creating objects that contain other objects as part of their internal structure, forming a \"whole-part\" relationship.\n",
        "\n",

        "5. Flexibility: Composition provides flexibility by allowing objects to be easily composed and reconfigured at runtime. By combining different components, objects can adapt to changing requirements or scenarios.\n",

        "6. Hierarchy: Composition can be hierarchical, meaning that components themselves can contain other components, forming a nested structure. This allows for the creation of complex systems with varying levels of granularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Dependency Management: Composition manages dependencies between objects by establishing clear relationships and defining how components interact with each other. Changes in one component typically do not affect unrelated components, enhancing code stability."

The purpose of pseudoprivate attributes is to provide a form of name scoping within a class, making the attributes less likely to be accidentally overridden or accessed externally.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, pseudoprivate attributes are created by prefixing a double underscore (__) to the attribute name. For example, __attribute or __variable. When a name is pseudoprivate, the Python interpreter performs name mangling by adding a prefix _ClassName to the attribute name. This ensures that the attribute is still accessible from within the class but is harder to access from outside the class.\n",

        "The purpose of pseudoprivate attributes includes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Encapsulation: Pseudoprivate attributes support the encapsulation principle of object-oriented programming by providing a way to define attributes that are intended for internal use within a class. They signal that these attributes should not be directly accessed or modified from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Name Collision Avoidance: Pseudoprivate attributes help avoid accidental name collisions in subclassing scenarios. When a subclass defines an attribute with the same name as a pseudoprivate attribute in the parent class, the pseudoprivate attribute is effectively renamed with the class-specific prefix, preventing unintended attribute conflicts.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Information Hiding: By using pseudoprivate attributes, you can hide implementation details and internal state from external code. This improves code maintainability and reduces the risk of unwanted modifications to internal attributes."
