        "Ans- The purpose of Python's object-oriented programming (OOP) is to provide a programming paradigm that allows for the creation of modular, reusable, and maintainable code. OOP is based on the concept of objects, which are instances of classes, and it organizes code around these objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some key purposes of Python's OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "Modularity: OOP allows you to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable entities called objects. Each object encapsulates its own data (attributes) and behavior (methods), which promotes code modularity and reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Organization: OOP provides a way to structure your code in a logical and organized manner. You can define classes to represent real-world or abstract entities, and each class contains its own set of attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of hiding internal details and providing a public interface to interact with an object. It allows you to define access levels for attributes and methods, controlling how they can be accessed and modified from outside the object. This helps to protect data integrity and improves code maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows you to create new classes (derived or child classes) based on existing classes (base or parent classes). The derived classes inherit attributes and methods from the base classes, promoting code reuse and allowing you to create specialized classes that inherit and extend the functionality of their parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables you to write code that can work with objects of multiple types, providing flexibility and extensibility. Polymorphism is often achieved through method overriding and method overloading."

        "Ans- In Python, when an attribute is accessed on an object, the inheritance search looks for the attribute in a specific order known as the Method Resolution Order (MRO). The MRO determines the sequence in which the classes involved in inheritance are searched for the attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "The MRO is based on the C3 linearization algorithm, which ensures that the attribute lookup follows a consistent and predictable order. The MRO order is defined by the class hierarchy and the order in which the base classes are specified during class definition.\n",
        "\n",
        "The inheritance search for an attribute follows the following MRO order:\n",
        "\n",
        "The instance itself: The attribute is first searched for in the instance itself. If the attribute exists in the instance, it is directly accessed.\n",
        "\n",
        "The instance's class: If the attribute is not found in the instance, the search continues in the instance's class. Python checks if the attribute exists in the class definition.\n",
        "\n",
        "Base classes: If the attribute is not found in the instance or its class, the search proceeds to the base classes in the order specified by the MRO. Each base class is checked in the order defined by the MRO, and if the attribute is found in any of the base classes, it is accessed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Base class hierarchy: If the attribute is not found in the immediate base classes, the search continues in the hierarchy of base classes in the order specified by the MRO. This process continues until the attribute is found or all base classes and their hierarchies are exhausted.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the attribute is not found at any step of the inheritance search, a AttributeError is raised.\n",

In cases of multiple inheritance, the MRO helps to define the order in which the base classes are traversed for attribute lookup"
