        "\n",
        "In Python, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will possess. Understanding classes allows you to define custom types and create instances (objects) of those types.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Class:** A class is defined using the class keyword and encapsulates data and functions into a single unit. It defines the structure and behavior of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Object:** An object is an instance of a class. It represents a particular entity created from a class and can access the attributes and methods defined in its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "By understanding classes and objects, you can create reusable code, organize data and functions logically, and model real-world entities in your programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inheritance:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance\n",
        "is a crucial concept in OOP that enables code reuse and supports the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. With inheritance, a class can inherit attributes and methods from another class, known as the superclass or parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Superclass/Parent class: The class from which attributes and methods are inherited is called the superclass or parent class.\n",
        "Subclass/Child class: The class that inherits attributes and methods from a superclass is called the subclass or child class."
