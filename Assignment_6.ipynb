        "Ans- Exception processing is a vital aspect of error handling in programming. It allows you to detect and handle exceptional conditions that may occur during the execution of a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Error Handling: Exception processing is extensively used for error handling in software development. It enables you to catch and handle errors or exceptional situations gracefully, preventing the program from crashing or producing incorrect results. By using try-except blocks, you can identify specific types of exceptions and provide appropriate actions or error messages to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, when working with file operations, exceptions like \"File not found\" or \"Permission denied\" may occur. With exception processing, you can catch these exceptions and display user-friendly error messages, allowing the program to handle such issues without terminating abruptly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Input Validation: Exception processing is valuable for validating user input and handling invalid or unexpected data. It allows you to verify the correctness of user-provided values and respond appropriately when input fails validation criteria. By raising custom exceptions or using predefined exception types, you can prompt users to correct their input or take alternative actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, if a program expects a numeric input but receives a non-numeric value, an exception can be raised to indicate the error, allowing the program to request valid input from the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Resource Management: Exception processing is also used for proper resource management, such as closing file handles, database connections, or network connections. By employing try-finally or try-except-finally blocks, you can ensure that resources are released and cleaned up reliably, even if an exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if an exception is encountered while writing data to a file, the finally block can still execute to close the file handle, ensuring that resources are properly freed regardless of the exception."

        "Ans- If you don't do something extra to handle an exception, it will propagate up the call stack until it is caught and handled or until it reaches the top-level of your program\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Program Termination: If an exception is not caught and handled, it will eventually reach the top-level of your program. At that point, if no exception handling mechanism is in place, the program will terminate abruptly. This can lead to a crash and an undesirable user experience.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Unpredictable Behavior: Without proper exception handling, the program's behavior in the presence of exceptions becomes unpredictable. The exception might cause unexpected side effects, data corruption, or incorrect results. Not handling exceptions can make the program's behavior difficult to understand and debug.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Resource Leakage: If exceptions are not handled correctly, resources such as file handles, database connections, or network sockets may not be properly released. This can lead to resource leakage, where resources are not freed, causing potential issues like memory leaks or blocking future resource allocations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Incomplete Transactions: Exceptions can occur during transactional operations, such as database transactions or file write operations. Without proper exception handling, the program may leave transactions in an inconsistent state, leading to data integrity issues or incomplete operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Poor User Experience: When exceptions are not handled, users may encounter cryptic error messages or unexpected program termination. This can result in a poor user experience and frustration for users who are unable to understand the cause of the error or take corrective actions."

Provide Default Values or Fallback Behavior: If an exception occurs, you can provide default values or fallback behavior to ensure that your program can continue running with sensible defaults.

You can catch the exception at a higher level in your program, perform any necessary cleanup or logging operations, and then exit the program with an appropriate exit code."
