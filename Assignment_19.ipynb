For example, a Car class may have attributes like num_wheels or fuel_type, which represent characteristics shared by all cars.\n",

They encapsulate actions or operations that can be performed on the objects. Methods can manipulate the class attributes and the instance data, perform computations, interact with other objects, and provide functionality to the instances. For instance, a Car class may have methods like start_engine() or accelerate(), which define the behavior of starting the car's engine or accelerating the car.\n",

This knowledge can include class methods, class variables, and other class-level operations that are not specific to individual instances. For example, a Math class may contain class methods like square() or sin(), which perform mathematical operations and are not dependent on any particular instance.\n",

Methods are bound to the class and can be invoked on individual instances of the class.\n",
        "\n",

Regular functions, on the other hand, do not have direct access to instance data unless passed as arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Implicit First Parameter: Methods have an implicit first parameter called self (by convention), which refers to the instance on which the method is called. This allows the method to access the instance attributes and other methods of that instance. Regular functions do not have this implicit first parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Inheritance and Polymorphism: Methods are inherited by subclasses, allowing for method overriding and polymorphism. Subclasses can redefine or extend the behavior of methods inherited from the parent class, enabling customization based on specific requirements. Regular functions do not have this inheritance and polymorphic behavior by default.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Encapsulation and Data Hiding: Methods can be used to encapsulate the internal workings of an object, allowing access to the object's data through well-defined interfaces. They provide a way to control access to the object's attributes and maintain data integrity. Regular functions do not provide this encapsulation mechanism."

        "Ans-A reflection method, also known as an introspection method, is used to examine or manipulate the internal structure or behavior of an object at runtime. It allows you to access information about the object's class, attributes, methods, and perform operations based on that information. The necessity of using a reflection method depends on the specific requirements and use case. Here are some scenarios where a reflection method may be necessary or unnecessary:\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Dynamic Code Generation: When you need to dynamically generate code or modify the behavior of objects or classes at runtime, reflection methods like getattr(), setattr(), or exec() can be helpful. This is often useful in scenarios where the structure or behavior of the objects needs to be determined dynamically.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Frameworks and Libraries: Reflection methods are commonly used in frameworks and libraries to provide extensibility and customization. They allow the framework to examine and interact with user-defined classes and objects without having prior knowledge of their specific implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Debugging and Inspection: Reflection methods can be useful for debugging and inspection purposes, allowing you to dynamically examine the state of objects or retrieve information about their attributes and methods during runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Not necessary to use a reflection method**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Static Code: In many cases, when the structure or behavior of the objects is known and static, there may not be a need to use reflection methods. If the code is designed with well-defined interfaces and clear separation of concerns, direct access to attributes and methods without reflection can be sufficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Standard Operations: For standard operations like attribute access, method invocation, or property access, using the regular syntax or conventional approaches is often more readable and straightforward compared to using reflection methods. Reflection methods may add unnecessary complexity in such cases.\n",
