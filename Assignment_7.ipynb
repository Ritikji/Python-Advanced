        "\n",
        "2. Exception Handling: The raise statement is an integral part of the exception handling mechanism in Python. It triggers the flow of control to exit the current code block and transfers it to an exception handling block (except block) that can handle the raised exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Custom Exceptions: The raise statement enables you to create and raise custom exceptions. You can define your own exception classes by inheriting from built-in exception types or creating custom exception hierarchies. This allows you to handle specific exceptional scenarios in a structured and specialized manner.\n",
        "\n",
